<h1>Goo-A-Pipe-Fantasy</h1>
<h6>Racket Game Project</h6>
<p align="center">The purpose of this project is to create a simplified version of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/win3_PipeDr3x">Pipe Dream</a> game. It is a simulation in which you connect pipes placed on a grid  to allow the green goo to flow through the pipes until reaching an eventual end point from the incoming chain of pipes.</p>
